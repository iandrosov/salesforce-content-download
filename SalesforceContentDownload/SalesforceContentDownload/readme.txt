This app demonstrates use of Chatter REST API to download content files from
Salesforce Content. For this simple demo we download chatter files uploaded by Chatter Users,
but any content file can be donlaoded to mobel device using this method.

This app was created from the SalesforceMobileSDK Native Rest App template.

The login host can be configured in system Settings on the device:
You can switch between Production, Sandbox, or a custom host if needed.

In addition, selecting Logout in Settings will force your application to logout of the current Salesforce account the next time the app is launched.
